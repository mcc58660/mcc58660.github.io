	<p>Hi there, my name is Madeleine “Maddy” Cho and I am from Suwanee, Georgia, which is conveniently located only an hour and a half from UGA. 
	I am currently a freshman at UGA and I plan on majoring from <a href="http://www.terry.uga.edu/">Terry Business College</a> 
	with a degree in Management Information Systems. I am so excited to be a Bulldog, and coincidentally, I have been a Bulldog for life as 
	through middle school and high school I was also a bulldog. I guess it is just meant to be that I am a bulldog again, and now an official 
	bulldog for life.</p>
	
	<p>Going into college, I really did not know what to expect. I read some college blogs and talked to friends already in college, 
	but by the end of it, I still felt uneasy about leaving home and getting to college. How were classes going to be? How am I going to 
	manage my time? Is college like high school? With those questions in mind, the goal of my website is to share with you and give
	you a glimpse of a typical day as a UGA freshman. Everyone has a different college experience, 
	and here is mine.</p>
